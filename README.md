# Genetic Algorithm for MANET
A repository for the 2022/23 winter semester course - Bio-Inspired Networking.


# Topic ideas:

## Medium difficulty

- Neural network hyperparameters discovery using genetic algorithms
  Modeling of hyperaparameters in order to generate the model with highest accuracy.

- Discovery of best timetables/time management algorithm.

## High difficulty

- Body stabilty modeling
  Modeling leg structures that represent highest stability

- Some sort of ecosystem modeling, with a specific goal and fitness function

- Simulation of slime mold (or other mold types) for naturalistic minimum spanning trees.
